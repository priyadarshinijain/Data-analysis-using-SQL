# Data Analysis Using SQL - Bella's Pizzeria üçï

This project focuses on **data management**, **querying**, and **analysis** using SQL for Bella's Pizzeria. The objective is to address several operational and customer satisfaction challenges by leveraging the power of **SQL** and **database management** tools. Below is an outline of the tools and techniques involved in this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

### 1. **Database Management System (DBMS)**

- **MySQL**:  
  Bella's Pizzeria uses **MySQL**, a widely-used open-source relational database management system (**RDBMS**) to handle structured data, such as:
  - Customer orders
  - Pizza types
  - Inventory

### 2. **SQL Querying Techniques**

- **Basic CRUD Operations**:  
  CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**‚Äîthe fundamental operations used to manage data, such as:
  - Handling pizza orders
  - Updating the menu
  - Managing customer feedback or reviews

### 3. **Data Aggregation**

- SQL queries such as:
  - `GROUP BY`
  - `COUNT()`
  - `SUM()`
  - `AVG()`
  
  These are utilized to analyze sales data, identify best-selling pizzas, and aggregate customer feedback for better decision-making.

### 4. **Joins and Subqueries**

- **Joins**: SQL JOINs (e.g., **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**) are employed to link different tables, such as:
  - Orders
  - Customers
  - Inventory
  
- **Subqueries**: Used to perform complex filtering and data retrieval in comprehensive reports.

### 5. **Data Analysis & Reporting**

- SQL is used for **aggregating sales data** and **identifying trends**, such as the **top 5 best-selling pizzas**. Reports generated through SQL queries provide insights into:
  - Business operations
  - Customer preferences

### 6. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process**

- **ETL Tools**: An **ETL process** is set up to integrate various data sources, including:
  - Customer orders
  - Pizza inventory
  - Feedback data
  
  This ensures all relevant information is stored in a **centralized database** for easy access and analysis.
